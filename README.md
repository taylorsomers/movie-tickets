# Movie Tickets

  ### By Taylor Somers

## Description

  This website is a demonstration of what I have learned so far regarding constructing and manipulating objects in JavaScript. The functionality of the website is intended to calculate the price of a movie ticket based on factors such as the movie title, time of day for the movie showing, and age of the purchaser. While rudimentary, it shows the framework we have developed for developing more complex programs using object-oriented programming.
